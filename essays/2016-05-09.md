SELF-REALIZATION
"Travelling across the country with just a vehicle and some cash,  realizing the truths,....accepting the fate" 
                                    
I love to travel, travelling is one of the most efficient way of self-realization,interaction with nature paves way for self -discovery

Each and every human being should   experience the special force which will  enrich the uniqueness in oneself.
Its a dream to travel across a land which awaits a great deal of mysteries and mystique of Nature, and to experience it.
To leave everything behind you, your family, your relations, your friends and travel, allowing the lighting of nature to guide you.

To feel the energy of optimism,that draws  the relationship of your heart and soul closer, thus making oneself realize the purpose of one being in this world

some travel the world to search for the uniqueness in tastes, or some search for greatness in music.
, some travel to find peace. Ultimately the search comes to an end, whether they get what they desired or not might be a question, but they must have acquired some thing a change ,the change of self realization.


There comes a time in everyone's life, to stop dreaming and star living, living the life you want
because after a particular time, you may have   succeeded in your personal life, but ultimately when you turn back, the success wont make you smile, of course it might make your heart fill. but not happy.
memories are the only way you can relive the moments and be happy. Remember the door is open and you will always have  a choice.

You have got one life, live it to your fulfillment.
