PURPOSE OF LIFE
Have you ever wondered, whats the purpose of life?. 
Well i know this is the starting question to atleast 70% of  the boring lectures we have ever been to, in fact when i  created this blog, this was the question that just popped into my head, so i thought ,hey why not i explain it.

For at least 30% people out there definitely might think about life when they go on a solo trip to a calm place, when the scenery is amazing and when the wind just breeze through your face and hair, these are  esoteric people,we tend to think about life under these scenario.Then some people, might relate life to their current persona,when asked. while others talk about having a good rapport  with the people surrounding them.Sometimes we find happiness when we spend time with family or when we hang out with our friends.


According to me,Life is an adventure, its true im not just quoting that famous "someone" in fb who created the post or the back page of classmates notebook.
Its true,just think about it you cant predict whats going to happen the next day its like unpredictable shit or rather the next hour, anything can change.
Life is a Daring shit, you meet people,you make new friends or  sometimes you think about your old friends and feel nostalgic and stuff, or sometimes you just get addicted to a tv show or a movies and think " it will be fun to have  friends like that". But life is more than that, LIFE CAN BE GREATLY RELATED TO NATURE.  

"The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty" this film properly depicts Life.I came to realize that life,from a personal experience.

It was summer vacation, my family decided to take a trip to Europe. We have aunt there..blah blah blah stuff. It was 5.am in the morning dad woke me up, we decided to take a walk. We left the house and started walking enjoying the cool breeze and light snow,(ya it was winter there) then dad got a call work stuff and then he told he needed to use the lap so he wanted to go back, but i insited on walking a bit more,so he left and i started walking,it was beautiful the views,then i got enthusiastic and took it a bit further. i traveled 9 km inside a wood and then shit happened.!



ya..you're right -got lost.
Then the real adventure began ,it was like "Into The Woods"  No phone,No money nothing.
I sat next on a bark, and started smiling, (Ya when im in real deepshit,i smile, i know its weird)
Then i tried tracing back my path, but ya nothing,then I climbed up a tree to get a better view , but the tree was damn big and tall so couldn't  climb that one. I suddenly started reciting Robert frost's 


THE ROAD NOT TAKEN

"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth"

I spend one hour trying to trace back my way, but it only made my situation worse. Then came Lou (like a god i might add)
a guy of about 67 years old. I ran up to him and asked for the help,his house was nearby and he was a man of woods. Since this was a country side,almost all the people were old couples. I related what happened (of which most ,i cant say here :P) .He told me that i had come a long way to the lake side.
i.e i had been travelling in the opposite direction.He gave me his cycle and told me to go all the way around the woods. that means another 30 miles. 
It was this time, i realized what life actually is. It was not about following the usual procedure and going to school and college and then marrying. and then again continuing the procedure with your kids.
its about facing challenges in a different way, sharing happiness, ultimately you have to live each day thinking this is your last day.



"To see the world, things dangerous to come to,
 to see behind walls, draw closer,
 to find each other, and to feel. 
That is the purpose of life.."
